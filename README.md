# Project Overview

In this project we wrote some tests for a web-based application that reads RSS feeds using the Jasmine testing library. Each test is independent of the others and ensures that the feature it describes is working properly.


## Dependencies

jQuery
Jasmine 2.0 http://jasmine.github.io/

## Using the Project

Open the index file in your browser to see the Jasmine inspection of the application. Passes and failures are listed at the bottom of the page. To edit tests, use the feedreader.js file in the jasmine/spec folder.
